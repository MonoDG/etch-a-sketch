# ETCH A SKETCH

## The Odin Project
Author: David Gallego

## Functionalities
- Create the divs using JavaScript
- Put grid squares inside another "container"
- Make the divs appear as a grid (16x16 for example)
- Set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid
- Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated _in the same total space as before_ (ex: 960px wide) so that you've got a new sketch pad.
- You should be able to enter ```64``` and have a branch new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.
